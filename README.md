# Pokemon-game
Welcome to Pokedex Manager 3000, a thrilling console-based system for:

Creating your own Pokémon trainers (Owners),
Assigning them a majestic BST (Binary Search Tree) of Pokémon,
Doing epic fights, evolutions, merges, or just lazing around with your fuzzy data structures.
Features That'll Blow Your Mind
New Pokedex Creation
Because what is life without a brand-new Bulbasaur or Charmander?

Fight!
Let your creatures settle scores. Or watch them tie. It's all about the 1.5×Attack + 1.2×HP, baby!

Evolutions
We keep it simple: ID + 1 is the next step. Magic? Possibly. But who are we to question Pokémon logic?

Merging
Two owners walk into a bar; only one walks out –– with both Pokedexes combined. The other is “mysteriously” gone afterward.

Circular Linked List
Because life is a circle. Also because we want you to practice. You can loop around and around the owners like a carnival ride.

Enter owners’ names,
Insert Pokémon,
Evolve them or make them brawl in the ring,
Or do a fancy merge and watch an entire owner vanish from existence!
Exit
At any time, use the “Exit” option. The program will say a final goodbye. Possibly weeping in the background.
